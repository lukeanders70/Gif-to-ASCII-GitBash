# Gif-to-ASCII-GitBash
Pyhton 3 program that translates a .gif file into ASCII characters and plays it in the GitBash Terminal

Run Analyze.py with Python 3 and follow the prompts. Must be run in GitBash becuase it supprts the "\033[F" character, which will delete a previously printed line
If your images or gifs are distorted or have line breaks in the middle, try zooming out in GitBash or making your window larger

watch example.gif for an example of what you should see when things are functioning correctly
